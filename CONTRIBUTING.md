# Contributing to admin-portal

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! This project is used by [Grassroots Grocery](https://www.grassrootsgrocery.org/) to help distribute fresh produce to thousands of families in need in the NYC area. Learn about our [mission](https://www.grassrootsgrocery.org/our-mission). ‚ù§Ô∏è

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. üéâ

### Your First Code Contribution

First, you'll need to get the project up and running locally, which requires an AIRTABLE_API_KEY. Send an email to engineers@grassrootsgrocery.org to introduce yourself (if we don't know you already) and the team will be able to respond and provide you with a clone of the Airtable database and the AIRTABLE_API_KEY to connect to it from your local dev environment.

Once you have your AIRTABLE_API_KEY, see the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/grassrootsgrocery/admin-portal#running-the-dev-server) for how to run the project. You should be able to bring up the UI in your browser on localhost:5173 and login with the credentials provided. Congrats, you're ready to contribute!

Check out our list of open issues [here](https://github.com/grassrootsgrocery/admin-portal/issues). Feel free to comment, ask questions, or assign to yourself to work on one or more. We try to capture all the ideas and work items that require development in the issues list, but if there's something else you'd like to work on, raise a new issue!

### Submit changes as a new pull request

Once your changes are complete, submit as a new [pull request](https://github.com/grassrootsgrocery/admin-portal/compare) to the 'main' branch. Include description of what you changes, screenshots, etc, to help reviewers understand the change. Also, make sure to reference the corresponding GitHub issue (just reference the issue number in the description like "Issue #4"). We generally expect all new PRs to reference one or more issues.

Once the PR is approved, it will be merged to 'main' branch. The live site, https://portal.grassrootsgrocery.org/, pulls from the 'production' branch, which is periodically synced to from 'main'. 


### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/grassrootsgrocery/admin-portal/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to admin-portal users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

### Reporting Bugs

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to engineers@grassrootsgrocery.org.
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/grassrootsgrocery/admin-portal/issues/new). 
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their 


<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->
